abstract = {The "Zero harmful discharge regime" has been implemented on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) since the late 1990's, and has amongst other resulted in significant reduction of oil discharged with produced water. The current management strategy is to conduct Best Available Techniques (BAT) assessment for new fields/installations, assessing injection of produced water and adequate cleaning solutuions prior to discharge to sea. The current regulative requirement is 30 mg/l oil-in-water (as a monthly average) and the Norwegian regulator has announced a possible stricter limit at 10-15 mg/l for new field developments. The Norwegian petroleum industry finds this an inappropriate requirement, which will deviate from the principle of a risk based approach, and imply costly solutions not aligned to the actual level of environmental risk. This paper presents a holistic view on performance of produced water management on the NCS, including overview of solutions for all fields, with performance data and trends for the period 2009-2014, and discusses the benefit of continuing the management regime and regulation level of today.},

In recent years, the oil and gas industry has demonstrated strong commitment to change this traditional operations approach and move towards inherently safer philosophy in offshore facilities design and operations, i.e. removing human crew from the facility and operating it remotely from a safe location over extended periods. This paper aims to demonstrate the readiness of robotics technologies coupled with digitalization technologies in process control and facility automation in transforming offshore oil and gas production platforms into smart unmanned installations. This paper is focused on the application of smart robotics, with highly dexterous capabilities and equipped with multiple sensing instruments, in maintaining an offshore oil and gas production facility in full operation without a permanent human crew, and with planned visits to the platform at 12-week intervals, in a case study. The robots are developed to be remotely operated from an onshore control center and/or may be programmed to function autonomously for routine missions on the offshore facility.},

Moreover, challenges and opportunities of each method applied to PW treatment are comprehensively discussed. Furthermore, alternatives for reuse of treated PW are suggested and discussed.},

abstract = {Produced water (PW), a large byproduct of offshore oil and gas extraction, is reinjected to formations or discharged to the sea after treatment. The discharges contain dispersed crude oil, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkylphenols (APs), metals, and many other constituents of environmental relevance. Risk-based regulation, greener offshore chemicals and improved cleaning systems have reduced environmental risks of PW discharges, but PW is still the largest operational source of oil pollution to the sea from the offshore petroleum industry. Monitoring surveys find detectable exposures in caged mussel and fish several km downstream from PW outfalls, but biomarkers indicate only mild acute effects in these sentinels. On the other hand, increased concentrations of DNA adducts are found repeatedly in benthic fish populations, especially in haddock. It is uncertain whether increased adducts could be a long-term effect of sediment contamination due to ongoing PW discharges, or earlier discharges of oil-containing drilling waste. Another concern is uncertainty regarding the possible effect of PW discharges in the sub-Arctic Southern Barents Sea. So far, research suggests that sub-arctic species are largely comparable to temperate species in their sensitivity to PW exposure. Larval deformities and cardiac toxicity in fish early life stages are among the biomarkers and adverse outcome pathways that currently receive much attention in PW effect research. Herein, we summarize the accumulated ecotoxicological knowledge of offshore PW discharges and highlight some key remaining knowledge needs.},

@article{Smit2020,
abstract = {There is a global trend towards the application of risk based assessment (RBA) techniques for assessing and managing environmental risks and considering the potential impacts from discharges of produced water. One of the benefits of RBA is the absence of generic end-of-pipe limits for individual produced water components. Instead, it allows for flexibility to evaluate environmental risks and potential impacts of site-specific discharges on a case-by-case basis. Several global oil and gas operators have developed in-house approaches, guidelines and principles for evaluating these risks for communication to agencies and the public and for decision making. As such, a range of risk endpoints is being applied, each of them based on specific assumptions, input parameters with varying levels of empirical data requirements, and conservatism. This situation hampers straightforward comparison across companies and regulatory frameworks. The International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP) has recognized a need for alignment to support more consistent application and communication of RBA concepts. Therefore, a new IOGP project was sponsored, including formation of a Task Force to define industry good practice for RBA approaches, based on an inventory of methods currently used by member companies together with a review of existing regulatory approaches around the world. Tools have been catalogued and the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying risk principles have been analysed along with the protection goals they support. Two main principles were identified; Uncertainty-implicit and uncertainty-explicit approaches, each with their own application areas. The second phase of the project focused on the development of consensus industry guidance including a common tiered framework for RBA. The main objective of this work is to achieve harmonization in the way operators execute RBA for offshore produced water discharges as this will likely enhance broader understanding and acceptance of RBA techniques internationally. This paper will provide a summary of the inventory of RBA methods and tools collected by the Task Force and will present the main elements of the proposed common RBA framework for produced water discharges. This will include recommendations e.g. on how to characterize produced water composition, how to define appropriate mixing zones, and what data is needed to decide whether risk can be considered adequately controlled.},

The scope includes all aspects of hydraulic design, 3D-flow phenomena and partload operation, cavitation, numerical flow calculations, hydraulic forces, pressure pulsations, noise, pump vibrations (notably bearing housing vibration diagnostics and remedies), pipe vibrations, pump characteristics and pump operation, design of intake structures, the effects of highly viscous flows, pumping of gas-liquid mixtures, hydraulic transport of solids, fatigue damage to impellers or diffusers, material selection under the aspects of fatigue, corrosion, erosion-corrosion or hydro-abrasive wear, pump selection, and hydraulic quality criteria. As a novelty, the 3rd ed. brings a fully analytical design method for radial impellers, which eliminates the arbitrary choices inherent to former design procedures. The discussions of vibrations, noise, unsteady flow phenomena, stability, hydraulic excitation forces and cavitation have been significantly enhanced. To ease the use of the information, the methods and procedures for the various calculations and failure diagnostics discussed in the text are gathered in about 150 pages of tables which may be considered as almost unique in the open literature. The text focuses on practical application in the industry and is free of mathematical or theoretical ballast. In order to find viable solutions in practice, the physical mechanisms involved should be thoroughly understood.

It is well known that the daily production optimization problem is well suited for mathematical optimization. The contribution of this paper is a discussion on appropriate formulations, in particular the use of static models vs. dynamic models. We argue that many important problems can indeed be solved by repetitive use of static models while some problems, in particular related to shale gas systems, require dynamic models to capture key process characteristics. The reason for this is how reservoir dynamics interacts with the dynamics of the production system.},

abstract = {Waterflooding development is one of the most common methods in oilfields. The energy consumption of waterflooding system accounts for a large proportion of the total in oilfield development. Therefore, the optimization of waterflooding system is able to further decrease operation cost and enhance development efficiency. But it is complicated to optimize operation control of large-scale waterflooding pipeline networks as a result of lots of wells and complex waterflooding pipeline networks. Although previous scholars have done much research, few have considered technical constraints of waterflooding networks. This paper puts forward a quantitative evaluation approach to pressure and flowrate sensitivity of waterflooding pipeline networks firstly, and concludes that the pressure and flowrate sensitivity are related to network topological structures, pipeline parameters and current operation flowrates. Meanwhile, an operation optimization approach to large-scale oilfield waterflooding system based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is proposed, which considers pump characteristic curves, adopts Hazen–William formula to simulate hydraulic pressure drop of pipe segments and deals with nonlinear items by phased linearization method. With the demand flowrate, the optimal pumping scheme of waterflooding station, pumping flowrate and throttling pressure of each well can be efficiently worked out. Finally, this approach is successfully applied to a virtual waterflooding system with 15 wells and a large-scale real one with 82 wells in China. Results show that the model has better practicality for the operation control optimization of waterflooding pipeline networks with larger scale and stronger sensitivity.},

abstract = {Waterflooding is a process where water is injected into an oil reservoir to supplement its natural pressure for increment in productivity. The reservoir properties are highly heterogeneous, its states change as production progresses which require varying injection and production settings for economic recovery. As water is injected into the reservoir, more oil is expected to be produced. There is also likelihood that water is produced in association with the oil. The worst case is when the injected water meanders through the reservoir, it bypasses pools of oil and gets produced. Therefore, any effort geared toward finding the optimal settings to maximize the value of this venture can never be over emphasized. Waterflooding can be formulated as an optimal control problem. However, traditional optimal control is an open-loop solution, hence cannot cope with various uncertainties inevitably existing in any practical systems. Reservoir models are highly uncertain. Its properties are known with some degrees of certainty near the well-bore region only. In this work, a novel data-driven approach for control variable (CV) selection was proposed and applied to reservoir waterflooding process for a feedback strategy resulting in optimal or near optimal operation. The results indicated that the feedback control method was close to optimal in the absence of uncertainty. The loss recorded in the value of performance index, net present value (NPV) was only 0.26{\%}. Furthermore, the new strategy performs better than the open-loop optimal control solution when system/model mismatch was considered. The performance depends on the scale of the uncertainty introduced. A gain in NPV as high as 30.04{\%} was obtained.},

For the optimal waterflooding strategy and surface waterflooding pipeline network operation control plan, this paper proposes a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model with the total profit of waterflooding development as the objection function, considering the oil reservoir characteristics. Based on the reservoir numerical simulation, the relationships between the water injection and oil production of four reservoir types are acquired. In the proposed model, various technical and operational constraints are considered for the safe and efficient operation of the pipeline network. Due to the nonlinearity of partial equations in the model, a piecewise linear approximation method is adopted in this paper, and the proposed MINLP model is converted into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, which can be solved by the commercial solver. Finally, taking a real-world waterflooding oilfield in Daqing, China as an example, the applicability of the model are testified, and the superiority of considering the reservoir characteristics is detailedly illustrated.},

abstract = {Waterflooding is the use of water injection to enhance the oil recovery in mature oil reservoirs. In this paper an adaptive algorithm has been introduced for waterflooding management in oil reservoirs based on proxy modeling technique. The presented approach is capable to handle the time-varying nature and the inherent nonlinearity of the complex process. In addition, any variation either in market prices or in operational costs is compensated by the designed adaptive controller to fix the obtained profit (here, the net present value: npv) at a desired achievable value. The observed outcomes on 10th SPE-Model{\#}2 benchmark case study have shown that by using this algorithm, any feasible desired trajectory for the expected benefit can be satisfied during the waterflooding-based production. Since the suggested controller has adaptive structure, it can be re-adjusted continuously in each time-step, using available operational data, to take into account the reservoir dynamical variations as well as the external disturbances to present an acceptable performance. By including a monitoring module in the algorithm structure based on data fusion technique, the updated profitability/productivity status of the reservoir is estimated. By using this information the npv setpoint induced to the closed-loop system can be automatically re-adjusted such that it always remains in an acceptable and reasonable range. In conclusion, the proposed methodology is an applicable solution for fairly profit-sharing in different kinds of contracts. In other words, the gained profit can be appropriately allocated to the shareholders according to the contractual obligations or a defined npv trajectory while considering the current condition of the reservoir. This strategy helps to prevent from ultra-production in a specific period of time by the clients or contractors which may lead to an unexpected reduction in the share of other parties in the reservoir life-cycle.},

abstract = {While single pump design allows operation at high performance levels, multi-pumping systems are controlled to cover actual flow rate requirements, with less emphasis on power consumption. Widely accessible sensors and programmable controllers can improve this approach. This paper discusses the methodology for optimizing analysis of a complex pumping system with set of parallel centrifugal pumps. For this purpose, an experimental model pumping station, with four pumps in a parallel configuration, was designed and constructed. Auxiliary equipment allows control of each pump by three possible methods: (i) discharge valve, (ii) by-pass flow, and (iii) variable speed drive (VSD). For system performance optimization, three estimating strategies, that are functions of control input parameters at each pump were proposed: (i) minimization of power consumption, (ii) flow rate balancing and (iii) maximization of overall efficiency. A Uniquely developed (C++) genetic algorithm (GENOCOP) determined solutions and these were positively verified by measurements at the model experimental station. Results show the existence of multiple local extrema for all of estimating strategies. These solutions show it is possible to control a complex pumping station with various combinations of control parameters, giving similar results. This analysis demonstrates that the strategy of minimizing power consumption is the most energy efficient and proves the described methodology as a powerful tool for optimizing of complex pumping stations.},

abstract = {Produced water (PW) is wastewater generated from oil exploration, and requires treating for oil and suspended solids removal. The viability of an effluent treatment unit process for this duty is dependent both on its efficacy, in terms of oil removal and - for offshore applications especially - its size, in terms of its area (FA, m/h) and volume (FV, h -1) footprint per unit volume flow. The incurred footprint applies to both the individual unit (vessel, column or tank) and the collection (or array) of units/vessels in a skid. An assessment of unit process footprint based on available information has been conducted, in particular to the case where high-quality treated water is required for reinjection. The analysis encompasses technical data from specific proprietary technologies as well as generic information for process technology types. Technologies considered comprised hydrocyclones (HCs), induced gas flotation (IGF), media (nutshell) filtration (NSF), and crossflow membrane filtration (CMF). The analysis revealed the HC to incur the smallest area footprint, less than half that of an IGF, notwithstanding only ∼0.15{\%} of the total skid volume being used for the actual separation process. The CMF had a slightly smaller area footprint and less than half the volumetric footprint of the NSF, if the requirement for backflushing is considered. The fitting of the modular HC and CMF technologies to a skid incurs a considerable increase in the footprint, particularly for the HC where the volume occupancy is increased by an order of magnitude. It was concluded that spatial efficiency gains could be attained for modular processes if spacing of the HC vessels or membrane modules can be reduced, contributing significantly to the viability of CMF in particular. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The energy-saving potential of the new control strategy is studied with simulations and laboratory measurements. The energy consumption of the parallel pumps using the new control strategy is compared with the traditional rotational speed control strategy of parallel pumps. The benefit of the new control strategy is the opportunity to operate variable speed-controlled parallel pumps in a region which suggests improved energy efficiency and lower risk of mechanical failure of the controlled pumps compared with traditional control.

In this work we propose the use of reduced-order models for solving optimization problems in oil reservoir simulation using a Lagrangian barrier method for the treatment of nonlinear inequality constraints. The optimization with reduced-order models is done by employing a trust-region proper orthogonal decomposition (TRPOD) algorithm. In addition to the POD method, we also build a reduced-order model based on a discrete empirical interpolation method. In the algorithm, the first-order gradient of the objective function is computed by using the adjoint method, while the inverse of the second-order gradient is approximated using the BFGS method. The reduced-order models involve both the forward (state) and backward (adjoint) equations. Three optimization case examples in production optimization of oil reservoirs are used to study the method. They show that the TRPOD method works efficiently while simultaneously honoring the nonlinear constraints.},

Furthermore, if the optimization is combined with inversion, i.e., with updating of the reservoir model using production data, form of regularization is required to cope with the ill-posedness of the inversion problem. A potential way to address these issues is through the use of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), also known as principal component analysis, Karhunen-Lo{\`{e}}ve decomposition or the method of empirical orthogonal functions. POD is a model reduction technique to generate low-order models using 'snapshots' from a forward simulation with the original high-order model. In this work, we addressed the scope to speed up optimization of water-flooding a heterogeneous reservoir with multiple injectors and producers. We used an adjoint-based optimal control methodology that requires multiple passes of forward simulation of the reservoir model and backward simulation of an adjoint system of equations. We developed a nested approach in which POD was first used to reduce the state space dimensions of both the forward model and the adjoint system. After obtaining an optimized injection and production strategy using the reduced-order system, we verified the results using the original, high-order model. If necessary, we repeated the optimization cycle using new reduced-order systems based on snapshots from the verification run. We tested the methodology on a reservoir model with 4050 states (2025 pressures, 2025 saturations) and an adjoint model of 4050 states (Lagrange multipliers). We obtained reduced-order models with 20-100 states only, which produced almost identical optimized flooding strategies as compared to those obtained using the high-order models.

The acceleration is achieved by determining an improved initial guess for the iterative process based on information in the solution vectors from previous time steps. The algorithm basically consists of two projection steps: (1) projecting the governing equations onto a subspace spanned by a low number of global empirical basis functions extracted from previous time step solutions, and (2) solving the governing equations in this reduced space and projecting the solution back on the original, high dimensional one. We applied the algorithm to numerical models for simulation of two-phase flow through heterogeneous porous media. In particular we considered implicit-pressure explicit-saturation (IMPES) schemes and investigated the scope to accelerate the iterative solution of the pressure equation, which is by far the most time-consuming part of any IMPES scheme. We achieved a substantial reduction in the number of iterations and an associated acceleration of the solution.

The transport solver works on a coarse grid adapted by a fine-grid velocity field obtained by the multiscale solver. Both the multiscale solver for pressure and the flow-based coarsening approach for transport have shown earlier the ability to produce accurate results for a high degree of coarsening.

For additional speed-up, we develop mappings used for rapid system updates during the timestepping procedure.

The suggested functions are evaluated for an oil reservoir, where water is injected to improve its recovery factor. We find that life-cycle optimization of water-injection projects in terms of net present value (NPV) and net cumulative exergy (NCE) leads to consistent results. We show that managing reservoirs based on a long-term objective leads to significant reduction in their CO2 footprint. For oil production by water injection, commitment to reduce CO2 emission provides an opportunity to maximize the NPV of these projects. The sustainability of water injection into hydrocarbon reservoirs is highly dependent on the volumes of the injected and produced liquids. Above a critical water cut (80{\%} in this study), the energy efficiency of the project decreases dramatically, and its CO2 footprint increases exponentially.},

abstract = {De-oiling hydrocyclones are a promising choice for produced water treatment in the oil and gas industry. The compact nature of hydrocylones makes them suitable for offshore and subsea installations. The commitment toward reduction in environmental footprint makes it a necessity to maintain the efficiency of the produced water treatment system (hydrocyclones) under all plant scenarios. A mathematical model for de-oiling hydrocyclones can help to develop robust control algorithms to handle the uncertainties and to maintain high efficiency. In this paper, a simple first-principle model is developed for hydrocyclones. A pressure-flow relationship is derived using Bernoulli's equation, a droplet trajectory analysis is done for calculating the separation, and a dynamic mass balance is used for control purposes. A simple PI control algorithm tuned using the SIMC tuning rules is used to verify the model and its control properties.},

@article{Stokes2015,
abstract = {Human-induced climate change caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has become a significant concern. Although water distribution systems (WDSs) provide an essential service, they also contribute to the release of GHG emissions through the use of electricity from fossil fuel sources for pumping purposes. In this paper, the reduction of both costs and GHG emissions associated with the pumping operation of WDSs is considered. Actual (time-varying) emissions factors (EFs) for the South Australia electricity grid from February 2011 to January 2012 with a 5-min time step are used to evaluate pumping operational GHG emissions and are compared with the use of an average EF, which does not consider the time dependency of EFs. An estimated (typical) 24-h EF curve, which aims to replicate the important aspects of the time dependency of actual EFs, is developed and compared for use in place of actual EFs, for when the actual variations in EFs cannot be accurately predicted for the future. Additionally, modified estimated 24-h EF curves, representing different amounts of renewable energy (wind generation) penetration, are considered to test the sensitivity of solution development to the magnitude of the variations of timedependent EFs. Through the multiobjective optimization of pumping operations of a case study WDS, it is shown that solutions found using actual EFs can minimize GHG emissions by moving pumping to low-EF times of the day. Conversely, solutions found using an average EF can only minimize GHG emissions by pumping more consistently during the day. Additionally, solutions found using the estimated 24-h EF curve are very similar to those found using the actual EFs, suggesting that the estimated 24-h EF curve can accurately replicate the important characteristics of the time dependency of EFs and can be used in place of actual EFs to find solutions of reduced pumping operational costs and GHG emissions. Furthermore, solutions found using the modified estimated 24-h EF curves show that the development of solutions is dependent on the magnitude of the variations of time-dependent EFs.},
